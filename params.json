Having recalled how much I enjoyed the game in the past, I played it again to see if I would still find it entertaining, however it has not aged well. Much of the problem can be attributed to a terrible interface and overuse of random probability in nearly every calculation. With this remake, I intend to address these issues by making the game visually appealing and leaning far further towards skill than luck.\r\n\r\n# Feature List:\r\n\r\n* World Map that shows transitions between cities\r\n* Prices dynamically dictated by economic trends\r\n* Role-playing elements, resulting in a roguelike experience\r\n* Greater focus on long-term gameplay, with an endgame in mind\r\n* Time-control system","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
