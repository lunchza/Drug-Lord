<h1>Overview:</h1>

<p>Drug Lord is an old game that was written in Visual Basic by a solitary programmer. Having recalled how much I enjoyed the game in the past, I played it again to see if I would still find it entertaining, however it has not aged well. Much of the problem can be attributed to a terrible interface and overuse of random probability in nearly every calculation. With this remake, I intend to address these issues by making the game visually appealing and leaning far further towards skill than luck.</p>

<h1>Feature List:</h1>

<ul>
<li>World Map that shows transitions between cities</li>
<li>Prices dynamically dictated by economic trends</li>
<li>Role-playing elements, resulting in a roguelike experience</li>
<li>Greater focus on long-term gameplay, with an endgame in mind</li>
<li>Time-control system</li>
</ul>
